# Against Toxicity is finally here!

### Tired of the needless toxicity and hate that the PvP community is constantly spreading? Cope no more! _Against Toxicity_ is a simple chat bot that will automatically remind people to be nice, whenever they're being toxic!
## Features:
- Default to private messing (good for servers with a strict anti-spam policy)
- Friends list: ignores friends being toxic
- Per-server overrides: `Always public` and `Always /msg` when on certain servers (configurable)
- `!at` commands:
> - `!at -users` notifies player in a PM you're using the mod
> - `!at -download` sends the Github link to the player in a PM
> - `!at :3` secret!! :3
